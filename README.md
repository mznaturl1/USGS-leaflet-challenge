Module 15 Challenge

## Background
The <span style="color: green"> **United States Geological Survey**</span>, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. 

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In consulting, I hae been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will all them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

# Visualization of Earthquakes with Leaflet

## Purposes
- Better educate the public and other government organizations to the issues facing our planet
- Secure more funding for continued research and data collection

### Leaflet Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization

![Grayscale](./Images/grayscale.jpg "Grayscale View")

1. Dataset
    - Review and select datasets from [USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)
    - Data updates every 5 minutes. Selected [dataset](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson) that traces all earthquakes from past 7 days 
    - Study JSON

2. Import and visualize the data by doing the following:

    - Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

    - Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

    **Hint:** The depth of the earth can be found as the third coordinate for each earthquake.

    - Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

    - Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
